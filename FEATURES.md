# New Features: Human-in-the-Loop Enhancement

## Overview

The Agentic RAG Workflow application has been significantly enhanced with advanced human-in-the-loop capabilities, session persistence, and iterative quality improvement mechanisms. These features transform the application from a simple demonstration into a robust, interactive AI system that collaborates with users to ensure high-quality responses.

## 🔄 Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) System

### Core Concept

The Human-in-the-Loop system activates when the AI's confidence in its response falls below 75%. Instead of proceeding with a potentially inadequate answer, the system pauses the workflow and presents the user with multiple improvement options.

### Confidence-Based Intervention

- **Automatic Trigger**: When Agent 5 (Sufficiency Evaluation) determines confidence < 75%
- **Transparent Process**: Users see the exact confidence score and justification
- **User Control**: Multiple intervention options to improve the response

### Intervention Options

#### 1. 🔍 Refine Query
- **Purpose**: Improve the search query based on human feedback
- **Process**: 
  - User provides specific feedback about what's missing or unclear
  - AI refines the original query using this feedback
  - System re-runs retrieval and generation with the improved query
- **Example**: "Focus more on recent trends and include pricing data"

#### 2. 🌐 Search Web
- **Purpose**: Enhance response with additional web search results
- **Process**:
  - Performs enhanced web search even if local documents exist
  - Combines local knowledge with fresh web information
  - Synthesizes multiple sources for comprehensive answers
- **Benefit**: Adds current information and broader context

#### 3. 📄 Add Context
- **Purpose**: Allow users to provide additional context or upload more documents
- **Status**: Framework implemented, ready for extension
- **Future Enhancement**: File upload dialog, manual context input

#### 4. ✏️ Manual Enhancement
- **Purpose**: Direct user editing and improvement of responses
- **Status**: Framework implemented, ready for extension
- **Future Enhancement**: Rich text editor for response refinement

#### 5. ✅ Accept Response Anyway
- **Purpose**: User override when they're satisfied despite low confidence
- **Process**: Skips re-evaluation and proceeds directly to final output
- **Use Case**: When user has domain expertise or specific requirements

## 🔁 Iterative Improvement Loop

### Multi-Round Enhancement

The system supports multiple rounds of human intervention:

1. **Initial Response** → Low Confidence → **Human Intervention**
2. **Enhanced Response** → Re-evaluation → Still Low Confidence? → **Another Round**
3. **Continue** until confidence ≥ 75% or user accepts

### Re-evaluation Process

After each human intervention:
- **Agent 5 Re-runs**: Evaluates the enhanced response
- **New Confidence Score**: Provides updated confidence and justification
- **Decision Point**: Continue improving or proceed to final output

### Workflow Transparency

Users can observe the complete process:
- Real-time agent status updates
- Detailed execution logs with timestamps
- Clear confidence progression tracking

## 💾 Session Persistence

### Browser Session Storage

- **Technology**: Uses `sessionStorage` (not `localStorage`)
- **Scope**: Data persists during browser session, clears when tab/browser closes
- **Privacy-Friendly**: Automatic cleanup when session ends

### Persisted Data

1. **Agent States**: Current status and outputs of all 7 agents
2. **Chat History**: Complete conversation with sources and retrieved chunks
3. **Execution Logs**: All workflow logs with timestamps
4. **Document Chunks**: Processed document data from uploaded files
5. **Workflow State**: Current status (idle, running, awaiting_human_input, etc.)
6. **Human Loop Options**: Confidence dialog state and options

### User Experience Benefits

- **Refresh Resilience**: Page refreshes don't lose progress
- **Context Continuity**: Maintains conversation and document context
- **Workflow Recovery**: Can resume interrupted human-in-the-loop processes
- **Performance**: No need to re-process documents after refresh

## 🎯 Enhanced Agent Workflow

### Updated 7-Agent Process

1. **Agent 0 - Document Processing**: Processes uploaded files (persisted)
2. **Agent 1 - Query Refinement**: Enhanced with human feedback integration
3. **Agent 2 - Contextual Pre-Analysis**: Identifies key concepts
4. **Agent 3 - Dynamic Retrieval**: Intelligent local + web search
5. **Agent 4 - Response Generation**: Synthesizes multi-source information
6. **Agent 5 - Sufficiency Evaluation**: **Enhanced with re-evaluation capability**
7. **Agent 6 - Final Output**: Delivers validated, high-quality responses

### Key Enhancements

- **Pause/Resume Capability**: Workflow can pause for human input and resume
- **State Management**: Robust tracking of workflow progress
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of interruptions and failures

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### New Components

#### ConfidenceDialog
- **Purpose**: Interactive dialog for human intervention
- **Features**: 
  - Displays current response preview
  - Shows confidence score and justification
  - Provides action buttons with descriptions
  - Supports feedback input for query refinement

#### Enhanced GeminiService Methods
- `refineQueryWithFeedback()`: Incorporates human feedback into query refinement
- `enhanceResponseWithWebSearch()`: Adds web search to existing responses
- `synthesizeResponses()`: Combines multiple response sources

### State Management
- **WorkflowState**: Tracks current workflow status
- **HumanLoopOptions**: Manages intervention dialog state
- **Session Persistence**: Automatic save/restore with useEffect hooks

## 📊 Quality Assurance Features

### Confidence Scoring
- **Transparent Metrics**: Users see exact confidence percentages
- **Justification**: Clear explanations for low confidence scores
- **Threshold-Based**: Configurable confidence threshold (currently 75%)

### Multi-Source Validation
- **Local Knowledge**: Prioritizes user-uploaded documents
- **Web Enhancement**: Adds current information when needed
- **Source Attribution**: Clear tracking of information sources

### Iterative Refinement
- **Feedback Loop**: Continuous improvement until quality standards met
